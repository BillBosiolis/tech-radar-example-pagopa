## Overview
Apache Commons is a project focused on all aspects of reusable Java components. It provides a collection of open source reusable Java components that are useful in a wide range of contexts in Java development. The Apache Commons project contains several libraries such as Commons Lang for enhancing the Java core classes, Commons IO for IO functionality, Commons Math for mathematical algorithms, and many more. These libraries aim to fill gaps in the JDK and provide additional functionality that may be useful to Java developers.
