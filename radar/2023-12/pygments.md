## Overview
Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python. It is a generic syntax highlighter suitable for use in code hosting, forums, wikis or other applications that need to prettify source code. Highlights are available for a wide range of languages, and output formats, with new ones being added continually. Pygments also includes a command-line interface for quick highlighting of files or code snippets.
