## Overview
Rest-Assured is a Java library that provides a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for writing powerful, maintainable tests for RESTful APIs. With Rest-Assured, you can test HTTP Post requests, Get requests, and much more. It simplifies the process of testing and validating complex responses, allowing for easy extraction of values from a response and verification of specific parts of a response. Rest-Assured supports a given/when/then test style and can integrate with Serenity for reporting.
