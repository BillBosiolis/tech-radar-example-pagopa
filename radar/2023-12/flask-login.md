## Overview
Flask-Login is a Flask extension that provides user session management. It handles the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering users' sessions over extended periods of time. It will store the active userâ€™s ID in the session, and let you log them in and out easily. It also helps handle the remember me functionality, and restricts views to logged-in users. It's intended to be a very flexible tool, allowing developers to extend and customize as needed.
