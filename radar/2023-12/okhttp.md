## Overview
OkHttp is an open-source HTTP client for Java applications. It's efficient, allowing synchronous and asynchronous network requests to be made. OkHttp also supports the SPDY protocol. SPDY is the basis for HTTP 2.0 and allows multiple HTTP requests to be multiplexed over one socket connection. OkHttp is developed by Square. It's a great choice for applications that require HTTP and HTTP/2 to fetch data over the internet.
