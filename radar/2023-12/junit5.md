## Overview
JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit, a testing framework for Java developers. The goal of JUnit 5 is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. It includes new features and improvements over JUnit 4, such as a modular structure, a new extension model, and improved assertions and assumptions. JUnit 5 is composed of several different modules from three different sub-projects: JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter, and JUnit Vintage. JUnit Jupiter is the combination of the new programming model and extension model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. JUnit Vintage provides a TestEngine for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based tests on the platform.
