## Overview
Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. It began as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has evolved into one of the most advanced WSGI utility modules. It includes a powerful debugger, full-featured request and response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL routing system and a bunch of community-contributed addon modules. Werkzeug is commonly used as a base for web application frameworks and is a part of the Flask framework.
