## Overview
Mockito is a popular mocking framework used in conjunction with writing unit tests in the Java programming language. It's used to create and configure mock objects. Using Mockito simplifies the development of tests for classes with external dependencies significantly. It allows you to write tests with a clean and simple API, and provides helpful failure messages out of the box. Mockito doesnâ€™t give you hangover because the tests are very readable and they produce clean verification errors.
