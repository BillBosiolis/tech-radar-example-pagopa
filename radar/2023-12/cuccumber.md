## Overview
Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers for testing other software. It supports behavior-driven development (BDD). This means that it can run automated acceptance tests written in a business-readable language. Cucumber allows you to write your test scripts in a way that can be easily understood by non-technical people such as business stakeholders. It was originally written in the Ruby programming language and was later extended to Java, JavaScript, and other programming languages.
