## Overview
Jackson is a suite of data-processing tools for Java comprising of three components: Streaming (jackson-core) defines low-level streaming API, and includes JSON-specific implementations; Annotations (jackson-annotations) contains standard Jackson annotations; Databind (jackson-databind) implements data-binding (and object serialization) support on streaming package. This package depends both on streaming and annotations packages. It is used for converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa.
