## Overview
Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It provides simplicity, flexibility and fine-grained control. It is unopinionated (meaning it does not make decisions for you about database storage, or web design patterns), and leaves the organization of your application up to you. It's a microframework that doesnâ€™t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features. It does have many extensions provided by the community that make adding new functionality easy.
