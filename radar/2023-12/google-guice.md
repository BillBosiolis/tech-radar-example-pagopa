## Overview
Google Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation and vice versa. It can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of. Gson provides options to print JSON in a well-defined and readable format. It is widely used for transmitting data between a server and a client, or for storing complex data structures in a human-readable format. It was developed by Google.
