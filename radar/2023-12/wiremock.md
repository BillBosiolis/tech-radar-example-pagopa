## Overview
WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. It allows you to stay productive when an API you depend on doesn't exist or isn't complete. It supports testing of edge cases and failure modes that the real API won't reliably produce. WireMock enables you to stub HTTP APIs, that is, make APIs that may not actually exist yet or that are out of your control return what you want them to return. This is particularly useful in microservices architectures where you might need to simulate an API in order to test its consumers in isolation.
