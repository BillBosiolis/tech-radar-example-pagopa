## Overview
Textual is a Python library for creating rich console applications. It is built on the Rich library, which provides rich text and beautiful formatting to the terminal. Textual extends Rich to provide advanced features such as interactive widgets (buttons, text boxes, etc.), mouse support, and more. It's a great tool for creating complex console user interfaces. However, please note that Textual is currently in the early stages of development and may not be suitable for production use.
