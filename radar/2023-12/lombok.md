Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java. It can be used to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write for Java classes. For example, it can generate getters and setters, toString, equals, and hashCode methods, and more. It does this through annotations that you can add to your classes.
