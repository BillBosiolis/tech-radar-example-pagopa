Log4j is a reliable, fast, and flexible logging framework (APIs) written in Java, which is distributed under the Apache Software Foundation. Log4j is a popular logging package due to its features of immediate logging via asynchronous loggers and its flexibility to output to multiple destinations, as well as its ability to be controlled by external configuration at runtime. It's used to output log statements from applications to various output targets.
