## Overview
Gunicorn, also known as "Green Unicorn", is a Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) HTTP server. It's a pre-fork worker model, which means that it forks multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests. This is in contrast to threading or async models. Gunicorn is commonly used to serve Python web applications in a production environment. It's often used with web frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid, and it's compatible with various web server software like Nginx.
