## Overview
Flask-WTF is an extension for Flask that integrates the WTForms library with your Flask application. It makes the process of creating forms and validating form data in Flask much easier. It also provides CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection out of the box, which is an important security measure when dealing with forms. Flask-WTF can generate forms from models, validate submitted form data, and more. It's a very useful tool for handling forms in Flask applications.
